			<div id="row1">
					<p>If you know me, you know my story. 
					I'm Nur Izzati Binti Alias, a 20-year-old continuing to 
					pursue her dream of becoming a successfull developer.
					As a computer science student, my ambition is to become a lecturer or a developer.
					My brother recommended me to take this 
					opportunity to learn in software 
					since it would benefit me in the future because, 
					in today's world, the world is at your fingertips. 
					  </p>

			<h2><br>Personally</h2>
			<div id="row2">
					<p>Music, photography, reading, designing 
					and movies are some of my favourite things to do. 
					I strive to achieve the proper balance between 
					structure and function in my efforts.
					My concept is one of simplicity, from technical 
					drawings to photographic captures and genuine representations 
					of my work as a designer.Nonetheless, my personal style is 
					minimalist, with clean lines and 
					sophisticated space-saving solutions. </p>

					<h1><br>One of my favourite movie: Coco(2017)</h1>
					<p>Coco has unforgettable beautiful graphics, 
					and not to forget the musical aspect is stunning in 
					the movie. The point behind the song ‘Remember me’ is a 
					strong one and comes out the value of a song could contain
					memory. "Family is priority",friends will come and go, 
					but family will always be there, so treat them with respect, 
					cherish them, and above all, never forget them. 
					Coco's overall story tells us that we should treasure 
					our family members not only while they are still alive, 
					but also after they have passed away.</p>
